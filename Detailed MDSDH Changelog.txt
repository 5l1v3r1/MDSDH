September 2012
Extensive code fixes done by novapaddy to get the mod working properly and not crashing any more.
This was done by going back to an earlier version, fixing that, and working forward to version 0.6.
Tested by Arcangelus, with his fixes and changes added.
Fixed version 0.6 is now version 0.7.
All of the above before this September note, is resolved AFAIK.

version 0.7.1

ARMENIA file fixed, with new ID's. (duplicate id's before).
99% of missing event pics are now in place (novapaddy).
OOB's are half-done,and Guglie_ is finishing them off.
vincesportsman is doing the tech files.
Other contributions have been included, including new city pics (ottoman master).
jimian re-did the Taiwan files (extensive).
AgentSmith2012 contributed the model pics, not allocated yet, as awaiting tech getting sorted.
Filled in some missing model pics and changed others.

Totally redid the ai files where required.
Added an event where required.

USA invasion of Iraq now works under AI control. 

Swapped Guglie_'s dprk, south korea and romania inc files
with Arcangelus's files (got rid of dummies).

Put back Decisions, added previously by Wilksjohnson.
Sahrawi removed as start up country.

Various minor changes found while playing. 

This version uploaded as MDS20701.
....................................


October 2012, DH 1.03beta released.

Main effort to clean up files in an effort to get rid
of the LAG issue, and make ready for DH1.03... which
has a new ERROR CHECKER, which finds ALL ERRORS.

Files in Config folder checked against DH1.03 files
and found to be in a total mess.

Files in config folder totally redone from scratch
using the DH1.03 files as Master, and MDS2 files
added/overwriting DH where needed.

db folder files as above, much less messy.
map folder files as above, used DH1.03 map files
and only added province_name file from MDS2.
New Minister files added from Arcangelus for DH1.03 added. 

Put all bases into the bases.INC file.. removed from
individual country INC files.
THIS MAY NEED REWORKING AS bases may be now missing?? cHECK

273 new AI files created so country's can now have their own
individual AI file, instead of default.ai or minor_default.ai
being used.

Removed DH Lite map from mod.
Set Tech year from 1000 to 2000. 

Only did minor gfx changes so far to suit DH1.03 new graphics.

..........

MDS2_07DH03 now the current version.
Loads and works in DH1.03
BUT, set error checker to 1, and there are still
gazillions of errors to be sorted out.
