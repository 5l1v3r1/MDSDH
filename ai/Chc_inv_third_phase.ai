# Third phase of Chinese invasions
# Triggered once Philipines are annexed (?)

# After this, Japan will become the target. This should not be very difficult, as the japanese army is 
# relatively small compared to the number of provinces it is covering. After a certain number of Victory 
# points has been taken, Japan will "surrender", which means that Japan will be out of the war. (not puppeted) 
# China will gain a portion of the Japanese fleet, (if still existing) some technology and military access.   

# China needs to keep conquering, and thereby ensuring that the US have no spare troops to send to Europe in 
# aid of the war against Russia. I will not go further in specific goals, just archiving the above will be 
# quite formidable. I've not set any specific provinces in terms of province ID, as you might have a better 
# idea than me on what will be the best route to victory. However, if you wish more detailed instructions, 
# I can give that.
