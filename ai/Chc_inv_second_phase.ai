# Second phase of Chinese invasions
# Triggered once Taiwan is annexed

# When WW3 starts it should concentrate on taking Taiwan first. This is very difficult, as Taiwan have a large 
# sized army and only 4 provinces to defend. Kinmen (added province near the chinese mainland coast) should fall 
# easily, so that leaves the island of Taiwan itself. China should get air superiority over the island, use it's 
# fleet to provide shore-bombardment and land troops en masse. If possible, paratroopers should be used also.

# Some forces should be guarding beaches on the mainland, of course, with concentrations around it's 3 main naval 
# bases. Vietnam has a very large army, which of a large part will be sent as exp-forces to China. China should 
# aid North Korea in it's war against South Korea, removing the only US-allied country on the mainland East-Asia. 

# After Taiwan has been taken, the US should be heavily involved by now, so the mighty US fleet and aircrafts based 
# of Guam and the Philippines needs to be be dealt with. China should use all of it's available aircrafts in naval 
# bombing and ensuring air-superiority over the Philippines. Swiftly after Taiwan has been subdued, the Philippines 
# should be invaded. This should be easy, unless the chinese fleet has been sunk. Guam should also be set as an 
# invasion goal.
